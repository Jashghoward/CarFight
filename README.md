Car Fight

A car compare application that compares two cars against each other. This is something fun where participants can campare the stats of certain cars against each other.

The api Im using for this application is https://api-ninjas.com/profile
The api key is - EtnvpekrLk4FHAqtSiwMFA==vBQ9W24GI94mYv2M

There is will be two search bars where the page used will have two sides.

This application is to use an autocomplete.js file that will work with the api to ensure ease of use for the search bars.

After adding the autocorrect has added a change to the application that adds to the user experience.

The cars will be compared on a few parameters such as: transmisson, fuel type, make, model.

Different parameters can be added or taken away.
